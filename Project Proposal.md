### Background
We are working on building a PunchEnder, a KickStarter Clone for charitable projects.

### Features
  * User auth - Users are able to create an account and login/logout.
  * Projects - Users will be able to start a project for a charitable organization, and help crowd source the funding needed to reach their goal. Users will be able to pledge a certain amount to the goal of the project.
  * Comments - Once a user has backed a project, they can then comment on the project, and communicate with other backers.
  * Rewards - If the project creator chooses, they can give a reward to the user for their pledge given to the cause.
  * Categories & Search - Projects can be searched and displayed on a search page. Categories can be used to filter the results.

### Technologies
  PunchEnder uses the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node) stack. The Apollo data graph platform is used to implement a GraphQL architecture between the front and back ends.
